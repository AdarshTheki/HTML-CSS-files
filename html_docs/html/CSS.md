## CSS Learning Process
Welcome to my CSS learning journey!

#### What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is a language used to describe the presentation of a web page written in HTML or XML. It allows you to control the colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design of a website.

#### Why learn CSS?
CSS is an essential part of web development, and without it, your website would only be a plain HTML page. By learning CSS, you can create visually appealing and user-friendly websites that stand out from the crowd.
