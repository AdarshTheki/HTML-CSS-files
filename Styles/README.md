# CSS Learning Process
Welcome to my CSS learning journey!

## What is CSS?

## Why learn CSS?
CSS is an essential part of web development, and without it, your website would only be a plain HTML page. By learning CSS, you can create visually appealing and user-friendly websites that stand out from the crowd.
